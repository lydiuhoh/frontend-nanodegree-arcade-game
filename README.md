## Instructions

1. Download all files and open index.html in a web browser.
2. Move your player up, down, left, and right with the arrow keys. Your goal is to reach the water without getting hit by one of the enemy bugs. If you are hit by one of the bugs, the game will reset and you will be back at the starting square. Good luck!
